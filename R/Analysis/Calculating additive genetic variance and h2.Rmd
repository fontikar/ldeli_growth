From Shin's paper:
Vp = VFixed + Vi + Vrandomeffects + Vr
Vi refers to the total variance explained by individual identity, including random intercept and random slope variance. NB: Vrandomeffects will include dam and permanent environment effects?

Vs refes to total between individual variance explained by random slopes
Vs = Vv * Vx
Vv = ID deviation from pop slope
Vx = Variance in covariate e.g.age, if scales Vx = 1 


Total phenotypic variation in growth
Vp = Vi + Vr ? Is this correct or do we have to include fixed effects as per paper? 
"Adjusted" Vp = Vi + Vdam + Vresiduals ?
Narrow h2 in intercepts =  Vi/Vp ?

#Total phenotypic variance of growth
Question: Do we need to account for the covariance among growth curve parameters? 
```{r}
Vtotal_p <- VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).liz_id"]  + #lizard variance in intercept
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"z_days_since_hatch:z_days_since_hatch.liz_id"] + #lizard variance in slope
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"I(z_days_since_hatch^2):I(z_days_since_hatch^2).liz_id"] + #lizard variance in curve
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).dam_id"]  +  #Dam variance in intercept
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"z_days_since_hatch:z_days_since_hatch.dam_id"] + #Dam variance in slope
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"I(z_days_since_hatch^2):I(z_days_since_hatch^2).dam_id"] + #Dam variance in curve
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"units"] #residuals
  
posterior_summary(Vtotal_p)
```

#Total additive variance of growth
Question: Do we need to account for the covariance among growth curve parameters? 
```{r}
Vtotal_a <- VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).liz_id"]  + #lizard variance in intercept
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"z_days_since_hatch:z_days_since_hatch.liz_id"] + #lizard variance in slope
  VCV.3.2.DA[,"I(z_days_since_hatch^2):I(z_days_since_hatch^2).liz_id"]  #lizard variance in curve

posterior_summary(Vtotal_a)
```

#Narrow sense Heritability of growth (all parameters)
h2 = Va / (Vp 
Question: Do we need to account for the covariance among growth curve parameters? 
```{r}
h2_growth <- Vtotal_a / Vtotal_p

posterior_summary(h2_growth)
```

#What if we wanted to additive genetic variance of specific growth parametrs and calculate heritability for each parameter? 
Question: Do we need to account for the covariance among growth curve parameters?
Question: What variance components should be in the denominator? If just calculating intercept only heritabilty, do we just have intercept only variance components in the denominator? As code below - this method is somewhat like calculating Rslope in my first chapter.

```{r}
#Intercept
h2_intercept <- VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).liz_id"] / ( VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).liz_id"] +
                                                                    VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).dam_id"] +
                                                                    VCV.3.2.DA[,"units"] )

posterior_summary(h2_intercept) #Values seem quite high? 

#Slope
h2_slope <- VCV.3.2.DA[,"z_days_since_hatch:z_days_since_hatch.liz_id"] / ( VCV.3.2.DA[,"z_days_since_hatch:z_days_since_hatch.liz_id"] +
                                                                              VCV.3.2.DA[,"z_days_since_hatch:z_days_since_hatch.dam_id"] +
                                                                              VCV.3.2.DA[,"units"] )
posterior_summary(h2_slope) #Values seem quite high? 

#etc for curvature
```

Alternatively, do we still have Vtotal_p (id intercept, id slope, id curve, dam intercept, dam slope, dam curve and residuals) as the denominator when we are calculating heritability? 
Question: Do we need to account for the covariance among growth curve parameters?

```{r}
#Intercept
h2_intercept_2 <- VCV.3.2.DA[,"(Intercept):(Intercept).liz_id"] / ( Vtotal_p)

posterior_summary(h2_intercept_2) #Values seem more sensible
```
